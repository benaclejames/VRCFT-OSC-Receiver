# VRCFT OSC Receiver
VRCFT OSC Receiver is a Blender addon to receive OSC data from [VRCFaceTracking](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking) and modify a mesh's shape keys accordingly, in real time!

## Installation
Simply download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFT-OSC-Receiver/releases) and install it like any other Blender addon!

## Configuration
Configuration is fairly simple! Just input the mesh you wish to preview, and then click start! Make sure you already have VRCFaceTracking up and running to avoid any issues!
If you wish to use a different port, you can change it in the addon preferences. If your shapekeys have a prefix, you can also change that in the addon preferences.
